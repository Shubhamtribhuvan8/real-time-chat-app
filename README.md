# Real Time Chat Application
This is a chat application that allows users to communicate with each other in real time. It includes the following features:
# Features
# 1. Google User Authentication

Users can log in and log out using their Google accounts via Firebase Authentication. This feature provides a secure and convenient way for users to authenticate themselves and access the chat application.

# 2. Chat Rooms

Users can create, join, and leave chat rooms. Chat rooms provide a space for users to engage in conversations on specific topics or with specific groups of people. Users can create new chat rooms or join existing ones based on their interests or preferences.

# 3. Real-Time Messaging

Messages sent by users appear in the chat room in real time. This real-time messaging feature enables instant communication between users, allowing them to see each other's messages as they are sent. It provides a seamless and interactive chatting experience.

# 4. Message History

The chat application stores the history of messages for each chat room. When users join a chat room, they can view the previous messages exchanged within that room. This feature ensures that users have access to the conversation history and can catch up on any messages they might have missed.

# 5. Private Messaging

Users can send private messages to other users. This feature allows users to have one-on-one conversations with specific individuals without the messages being visible to others in the chat room. It provides a private and personalized communication channel for users who want to have confidential or individual discussions.
